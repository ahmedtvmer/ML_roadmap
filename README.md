# The Machine Learning Engineer's Roadmap (2025 Edition)

## Phase 1: Foundational Prerequisites (2–3 months)

**Learning:**

1. Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization (DeepLearning.AI)
2. Python for Everybody Specialization (University of Michigan)
3. Machine Learning Specialization (Stanford University)

**Milestone Project:**

- Implement Linear Regression from scratch.
- Implement Logistic Regression from scratch.
- Implement Neural Network from scratch. "**Could be parallel to the next phase**"

***

## Phase 2: Deep Learning for Text (2–3 months)

**Learning:**

- First two courses of the Deep Learning Specialization (DeepLearning.AI)
- Learn PyTorch in Five Projects (freeCodeCamp)
- OpenCV Course (freeCodeCamp) "**Optionally**"

**Milestone Project:**

- Text Classifier From Scratch — Build a neural network for sentiment analysis using PyTorch. Use the FCC PyTorch course as a template for your implementation.

***

## Phase 3: Core MLOps \& Deployment (1.5–2 months)

**Learning:**

1. MLOps Course (DeepLearning.AI)
2. "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen

**Milestone Project:**

- Deploy the Text Classifier — Serve with FastAPI, containerize with Docker. Use your PyTorch model from Phase 2 for deployment.

✅ After this phase: entry-level freelancer (basic classification, simple deployment \& APIs).

***

## Phase 4: The NLP Bridge to Modern AI (1.5–2 months)

**Learning:**

1. "The Illustrated Transformer" (Jay Alammar)
2. Sentence-transformers for embeddings

**Milestone Project:**

- Embedding-Based Similarity Search — Find top-5 semantically similar sentences in a document.

***

## Phase 5: Advanced RAG \& Generative AI (2–3 months)

**Learning:**

1. Vector databases, LangChain, LlamaIndex
2. "LangChain for LLM Application Development" (DeepLearning.AI)

**Milestone Project:**

- RAG Q\&A System — Build a custom knowledge chatbot with full RAG pipeline.

✅ After this phase: decent freelancer (RAG, custom chatbots, doc Q\&A apps).

***

## Phase 6: Production Hardening \& Deployment (Capstone) (2–3 months)

**Objective:**

- Deploy the RAG system as a production-grade, monitored, and explainable service.

**Requirements:**

1. Containerize and deploy on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).
2. Add data validation (Great Expectations / Pandera).
3. Monitoring \& logging (Evidently AI, Prometheus/Grafana).
4. A/B testing architecture.
5. Bias audit + SHAP-based explanations.

***

## Total Timeline

- **Minimum pace (focused):** ~12–15 months
- **Part-time pace (while working):** ~18–24 months
