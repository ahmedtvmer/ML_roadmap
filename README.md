# The Machine Learning Engineer's Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Foundational Prerequisites**

* **LEARNING:**
    1.  **Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization** by DeepLearning.AI.
    2.  **Python for Everybody Specialization** by Michigan University.
    3.  **Machine Learning Specialization** by Stanford University.
* **MILESTONE PROJECT:**
    > **Project 1: Classic ML Model Implementation**
    >
    > * **Objective:** Implement Logistic Regression from scratch.

### **Phase 2: Deep Learning for Text**

* **LEARNING:**
    * Complete the first three courses of the **Deep Learning Specialization** by DeepLearning.AI.
    * Complete the **OpenCV Course** by FreeCodeCamp.
* **MILESTONE PROJECT:**
    > **Project 2: Text Classifier From Scratch**
    >
    > * **Objective:** Implement a simple neural network in NumPy to perform sentiment analysis.

### **Phase 3: Core MLOps & Deployment**

* **LEARNING:**
    1.  Complete the **MLOps Course** by DeepLearning.AI.
    2.  Read **"Designing Machine Learning Systems"** by Chip Huyen.
* **MILESTONE PROJECT:**
    > **Project 3: Deploy the Text Classifier**
    >
    > * **Objective:** Take the simple text classifier from Phase 2, wrap it in a FastAPI service, and containerize it with Docker.

> **✅ After this phase, you are an entry-level freelancer (Simple classification tasks, basic model deployment, API wrappers)**

---

### **Phase 4: The NLP Bridge to Modern AI**

* **LEARNING:**
    1.  **The Transformer Architecture:** Read **"The Illustrated Transformer"** by Jay Alammar.
    2.  **Embedding Concepts:** Learn to use a pre-trained sentence-transformer model to turn text into vectors.
* **MILESTONE PROJECT:**
    > **Project 4: Simple Embedding-Based Similarity Search**
    >
    > * **Objective:** Build a system that takes a sentence and finds the top 5 most semantically similar sentences from a document.

---

### **Phase 5: Advanced RAG & Generative AI**

* **LEARNING:**
    1.  Master **Vector Databases**, **LLM Orchestration Frameworks** (LangChain, LlamaIndex).
    2.  Complete deeplearning.ai's **"LangChain for LLM Application Development."**
* **MILESTONE PROJECT:**
    > **Project 5: Full RAG Q&A System**
    >
    > * **Objective:** Build a full-fledged chatbot that answers questions over a custom knowledge base.

> **✅ After this phase, you are a decent freelancer (Full RAG systems, custom chatbots, document Q&A applications)**

---

### **Phase 6: Production Hardening & Deployment (Capstone)**

* **OBJECTIVE:**
    > Take the RAG system from Phase 5 and deploy it as a professional-grade service. This is not just about making it live; it's about making it trustworthy.
* **PROJECT REQUIREMENTS & LEARNING:**
    > 1.  **Deploy the Service:** Containerize the full application and deploy it to a cloud platform.
    > 2.  **Implement Data Validation:** Use **Great Expectations** or **Pandera** to build a validation layer that rejects malformed API requests *before* they are processed.
    > 3.  **Integrate Monitoring & Logging:** Use **Evidently AI** or **Prometheus/Grafana** to create a dashboard. Your deployed service must output structured logs to track data drift, prediction quality, and system health.
    > 4.  **Architect for A/B Testing:** Design and document how you would deploy a challenger model alongside your current one for controlled, online evaluation.
    > 5.  **Ensure Compliance & Explainability:** Perform a bias audit on your system's outputs. Optionally, add an API endpoint that provides **SHAP**-based explanations for a given response.
