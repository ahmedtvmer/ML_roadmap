# The Machine Learning Engineer's Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundational Prerequisites (2–3 months)

* **Learning:**
  1. Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization (DeepLearning.AI)  
  2. Python for Everybody Specialization (University of Michigan)  
  3. Machine Learning Specialization (Stanford University)  

* **Milestone Project:**  
  **Classic ML Model Implementation** — Implement Logistic Regression from scratch.  

---

### Phase 2: Deep Learning for Text (2–3 months)

* **Learning:**
  * First three courses of the Deep Learning Specialization (DeepLearning.AI)  
  * OpenCV Course (FreeCodeCamp)  

* **Milestone Project:**  
  **Text Classifier From Scratch** — Build a NumPy-based neural network for sentiment analysis.  

---

### Phase 3: Core MLOps & Deployment (1.5–2 months)

* **Learning:**
  1. MLOps Specialization (DeepLearning.AI)  
  2. "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen  

* **Milestone Project:**  
  **Deploy the Text Classifier** — Serve with FastAPI, containerize with Docker.  

✅ After this phase: entry-level freelancer (basic classification, simple deployment & APIs).  

---

### Phase 4: The NLP Bridge to Modern AI (1.5–2 months)

* **Learning:**
  1. "The Illustrated Transformer" (Jay Alammar)  
  2. Sentence-transformers for embeddings  

* **Milestone Project:**  
  **Embedding-Based Similarity Search** — Find top-5 semantically similar sentences in a document.  

---

### Phase 5: Advanced RAG & Generative AI (2–3 months)

* **Learning:**
  1. Vector databases, LangChain, LlamaIndex  
  2. "LangChain for LLM Application Development" (DeepLearning.AI)  

* **Milestone Project:**  
  **RAG Q&A System** — Build a custom knowledge chatbot with full RAG pipeline.  

✅ After this phase: decent freelancer (RAG, custom chatbots, doc Q&A apps).  

---

### Phase 6: Production Hardening & Deployment (Capstone) (2–3 months)

* **Objective:**  
  Deploy the RAG system as a production-grade, monitored, and explainable service.  

* **Requirements:**  
  1. Containerize and deploy on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).  
  2. Add data validation (Great Expectations / Pandera).  
  3. Monitoring & logging (Evidently AI, Prometheus/Grafana).  
  4. A/B testing architecture.  
  5. Bias audit + SHAP-based explanations.
